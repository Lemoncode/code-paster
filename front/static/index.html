            <h3 class="instructions__subtitle">What can I use it for?</h3>
            <p class="instructions__text">
              You can use Code Paster to share code or any kind of text with
              partners, students, colleagues, etc. The trainer role (who can be
              one or more people) is allowed to write and read text. However,
              the student role is only allowed to read it. This particularity
              makes Code Paster a great and simple application to be used in any
              kind of online activity which requires text to be shared.

            <h3>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>
              In no event will the Licensor be liable for any damages, claims or
              costs whatsoever or any consequential, indirect, incidental
              damages, or any lost profits or lost savings, even if the Licensor

              or costs or for any claim by any third party. In no event will the
              Licensee be liable to the Licensor on condition that the Licensee

            <h3>6. NON-WAIVER</h3>
            <p>
              If a portion of this agreement is held unenforceable, the
              remainder shall be valid. It means that if one section of the
              Agreement is not lawful, the rest of the Agreement is still in
              force. A party‚Äôs failure to exercise any right under this
              Agreement will not constitute a waiver of (a) any other terms or
              conditions of this Agreement, or (b) a right at any time
              thereafter to require exact and strict compliance with the terms
              of this Agreement.
